Now available on iOS and iPadOS for the first time, outlines are a new multi-platform tool for expressing hierarchical data that work alongside stacks and lists. Learn how to use new and improved tools in SwiftUI to display more content on screen when using table views, create smooth-scrolling and responsive stacks, and build out list views for content that needs more than a vStack can provide. Take your layout options even further with the new grid view, as well as disclosure groups.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this video, we recommend first checking out “SwiftUI App Essentials,” which provides an overview of everything new in SwiftUI for 2020. If you’re brand-new to coding with SwiftUI, we also suggest watching 2019’s “SwiftUI Essentials” talk.","title":"Stacks, Grids, and Outlines in

Discover how people can take advantage of Scribble and handwritten text in apps that use standard text input controls or that implement a custom text editing experience. You’ll learn how it integrates into TextKit, and when you’ll need to adopt the new UIScribbleInteraction and UIIndirectScribbleInteraction APIs to provide a delightful and consistent experience with Scribble in your app.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with UIKit text input controls, as well as keyboard input technologies. To get started, watch “Keyboard Input in iOS”. If you’re building a custom text editor, you should be familiar with the UITextInput protocol, TextKit, and related text input APIs. For more information, we recommend checking out “TextKit Best Practices” and “The Keys to a Better Text Input Experience.” And for design guidelines on pencil-based interaction, check out “Apple Pencil Design Essentials.”","title":"Meet Scribble for iPad","originalPublishingDate":"2020-06-23T10:00:00-07:00","publishingExpiryDate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","platforms":["iOS"],"keywords":["cursive","handwriting","recognition"],"topicIds":[22],"type":"Session","images":["square","wide"],"codeSnippets":[{"title":"isHandlingWriting Example","startTimeSeconds":555,"endTimeSeconds":572,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-function\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">updateSearchCompletion</span><span class=\"syntax-params\">()</span></span> {\n    customSearchField.hideCompletionText = interaction.isHandlingWriting\n}"},{"title":"UIScribbleInteraction.isPencilInputExpected","startTimeSeconds":575,"endTimeSeconds":590,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">override</span> <span class=\"syntax-function\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">viewDidAppear</span><span class=\"syntax-params\">(<span class=\"syntax-number\">_</span> animated: Bool)</span></span> {\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"syntax-type\">UIScribbleInteraction</span>.isPencilInputExpected {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> lineHeight = textField.font?.lineHeight ??

(Don’t worry if you can’t read music, our clever Lizard is standing by to assist. It’s sure to be a note-worthy experience.)\r\n\r\nBy learning a little theory, and mastering time to create tones of different lengths, you just might help our Hero face the music… and move onto the next part of their quest.\r\n\r\nSwan’s Quest was created for Swift Playgrounds on iPad and Mac, combining frameworks and resources which power the educational experiences in many of our playgrounds, including Sonic Workshop, Sensor Arcade, and Augmented Reality. To learn more about building your own playgrounds, be sure to watch \"Create Swift Playgrounds content for iPad and Mac\".\r\n\r\nAnd don’t forget to stop by the Developer Forums and share your solution for our side quest.","title":"Swan's Quest, Chapter 3: The notable scroll","originalPublishingDate":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","publishingExpiryDate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","platforms":["iOS","macOS"],"keywords":["playgrounds","swan's quest","swans quest","swift","swift playgrounds","swift playgrounds challenge"],"topicIds":[36],"type":"Session","images":["square","wide"],"codeSnippets":[{"title":"Example Pitch Implementation","startTimeSeconds":123,"endTimeSeconds":129,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Example Pitch implementation</span>\n\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"syntax-class\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">enum</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">Pitch</span>: <span class=\"syntax-title\">Double</span>, <span class=\"syntax-title\">PitchProtocol</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">case</span> a4 = <span class=\"syntax-number\">440.0</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> frequency: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Double</span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">self</span>.rawValue\n    }\n}"},{"title":"NoteProtocol","startTimeSeconds":129,"endTimeSeconds":144,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Music.swift</span>\n\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"syntax-class\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">protocol</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">NoteProtocol</span> </span>{\n    \n    <span class=\"syntax-comment\">/// Play this Note through a ToneOutput</span>\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> tone: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Tone</span> { <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">get</span> }\n    \n    <span class=\"syntax-comment\">/// The duration of this Note as a multiple of quarter notes,</span>\n    <span class=\"syntax-comment\">/// e.g., a half note is 2.0, an eighth note is 0.5</span>\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> length: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Float</span> { <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">get</span> }\n}"},{"title":"Example Note implementation","startTimeSeconds":144,"endTimeSeconds":153,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Example Note implementation</span>\n\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"syntax-class\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">enum</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">Note</span>: <span class=\"syntax-title\">NoteProtocol</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">case</span> quarter(pitch: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Pitch</span>)\n    \n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> tone: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Tone</span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">switch</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">self</span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">case</span> .quarter(<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> pitch):\n            <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"syntax-type\">Tone</span>(pitch: pitch.frequency, volume: <span class=\"syntax-number\">0.3</span>)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> length: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Float</span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">switch</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">self</span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">case</span> .quarter(<span class=\"syntax-number\">_</span>):\n            <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"syntax-number\">1.0</span>\n        }\n    }\n}"},{"title":"Play more than one tone redux","startTimeSeconds":171,"endTimeSeconds":180,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Play more than one tone redux</span>\n\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> toneOutput = <span class=\"syntax-type\">ToneOutput</span>()\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> notes = [<span class=\"syntax-type\">Note</span>.quarter(pitch: .a4), .half(pitch: .c4), .quarter(pitch: .a4)]\n\n<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> index = <span class=\"syntax-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"syntax-type\">Timer</span>.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: <span class=\"syntax-number\">0.4</span>, repeats: <span class=\"syntax-literal\">true</span>) { timer <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">guard</span> index &lt;

Learn how we designed the Action & Vision app using Object Detection and Action Classification in Create ML along with the new Body Pose Estimation, Trajectory Detection, and Contour Detection features in the Vision framework. Explore how you can create an immersive application for gameplay or training from setup to analysis and feedback. And follow along in Xcode with a full sample project.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this session, you should have familiarity with the Vision framework and Create ML’s Action Classifier tools. To learn more, we recommend watching “Build an Action Classifier with Create ML,” “Explore Computer Vision APIs,” and “Detect Body and Hand Pose with Vision.” We also recommend exploring the Action & Vision sample project to learn more about adopting these technologies.\r\n\r\nWhether you are building a fitness coaching app, or exploring new ways of interacting, consider the incredible features that you can build by combining machine learning with the rich set of computer vision features. By bringing Create ML, Core ML, and Vision API together, there's almost no end to the magic you can bring to your app.","title":"Explore the Action & Vision app","originalPublishingDate":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","publishingExpiryDate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","platforms":["iOS","macOS"],"keywords":["action class","bean bag toss","body pose","camera","contour","core ml","cornhole","create ml","machine learning","object detection","trajectory","vision"],"topicIds":[16],"type":"Session","images":["square","wide"],"media":{"hls":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10099/1/27DE7B02-8000-41C6-9C33-E35587D1CD95/master.m3u8","tvOShls":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10099/1/27DE7B02-8000-41C6-9C33-E35587D1CD95/master.m3u8","subtitles":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10099/1/27DE7B02-8000-41C6-9C33-E35587D1CD95/transcripts/wwdc2020-10099-transcripts.vtt","downloadHD":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10099/1/27DE7B02-8000-41C6-9C33-E35587D1CD95/wwdc2020_10099_hd.mp4","downloadSD":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10099/1/27DE7B02-8000-41C6-9C33-E35587D1CD95/wwdc2020_10099_sd.mp4","duration":2187},"related":{"activities":["wwdc2020-10043","wwdc2020-10653","wwdc2020-10673","wwdc2020-10693","wwdc2020-10694","wwdc2020-10711","wwdc2020-10717","wwdc2020-10718","wwdc2020-10719"],"resources":[1339,1043,1042,901,443,134]},"trackId":3,"startTime":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","endTime":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00"},{"id":"wwdc2020-10859","staticContentId":4326,"eventContentId":10859,"eventId":"wwdc2020","webPermalink":"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10859","description":"Have a question about Audio Units, Workgroups, HAL, Toolbox APIs, CoreMIDI, AVAudioEngine, AVF APIs Catalyst apps, Spatial Audio, SoundAnalysis or AUVoiceIO?

Join the Swift team as we take a look at the programming language’s safety precautions — and when you might need to reach for unsafe operations. We’ll take a look at APIs that can cause unexpected states if not used correctly, and how you can write code more specifically to avoid undefined behavior. Learn how to work with C APIs that use pointers and the steps to take when you want to use Swift’s unsafe pointer APIs.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this session, you should have some familiarity with Swift and the C programming language. And for more information on working with pointers, check out \"Safely Manage Pointers in Swift\".","title":"Unsafe

In certain instances, however, demanding apps with exceptional performance requirements may only be able to provide the best experience on devices with an A12 Bionic chip or higher. \r\n\r\nWith Xcode 12, developers can now enable a setting for performance-intensive apps and games to indicate this requirement. We’ll walk you through the narrow circumstances for when to apply this setting and the app distribution trade-offs that must be carefully considered. \r\n\r\nBefore selecting this approach, you should have deep experience in optimizing your apps. Watch “Delivering Optimized Metal Apps and Games” for specific insights into the tools and best practices you can use to make your product work well on all supported devices.\r\n\r\nFor more on creating graphics-intensive experiences for your app or game using Metal, check out “Harness Apple GPUs with Metal”.","title":"Support performance-intensive apps and games","originalPublishingDate":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","publishingExpiryDate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","platforms":["iOS"],"topicIds":[71,26],"type":"Session","images":["square","wide"],"media":{"hls":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10621/8/B95598FB-EB54-46A4-AC4D-3CD09EA2F8FE/master.m3u8","tvOShls":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10621/8/B95598FB-EB54-46A4-AC4D-3CD09EA2F8FE/master.m3u8","subtitles":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10621/8/B95598FB-EB54-46A4-AC4D-3CD09EA2F8FE/transcripts/wwdc2020-10621-transcripts.vtt","downloadHD":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10621/8/B95598FB-EB54-46A4-AC4D-3CD09EA2F8FE/wwdc2020_10621_hd.mp4","downloadSD":"https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2020/10621/8/B95598FB-EB54-46A4-AC4D-3CD09EA2F8FE/wwdc2020_10621_sd.mp4","duration":343},"related":{"activities":["wwdc2020-10611"],"resources":[1153,1152]},"trackId":4,"startTime":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","endTime":"2020-06-25T10:00:00-07:00"},{"id":"wwdc2020-10160","staticContentId":3817,"eventContentId":10160,"eventId":"wwdc2020","webPermalink":"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10160","description":"Save yourself time and frustration: When you display data in your app — including dates, times, measurements, names, lists, numbers, or strings — learn how to format it correctly and provide a great experience.

how to improve iPad apps to leverage the increased screen size and additional features of iPadOS, and help people accomplish more with their devices. Discover how you can build detailed multi-column layouts and integrate lists into your app with little adjustment to your existing code. We’ll also explore reducing modality within your views to make it easier to navigate your interface with fewer taps and touches.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this session, you should have a general understanding of iPad app layouts and UIKit. For more information, watch “Making Apps Adaptive, Part 1.” And while not necessary, familiarity with UICollectionView may also be helpful. Watch “Advances in Collection View Layout” for an overview. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more about list creation for your apps?

With pose detection, your app can analyze the poses, movements, and gestures of people to offer new video editing possibilities, or to perform action classification when paired with an action classifier built in Create ML. And we’ll show you how you can bring gesture recognition into your app through hand pose, delivering a whole new form of interaction.\r\n\r\nTo understand more about how you might apply body pose for Action Classification, be sure to also watch the \"Build an Action Classifier with Create ML\" and \"Explore the Action & Vision app\" sessions. And to learn more about other great features in Vision, check out the \"Explore Computer Vision APIs\" session.","title":"Detect Body and Hand Pose with Vision","originalPublishingDate":"2020-06-23T10:00:00-07:00","publishingExpiryDate":"2025-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","platforms":["iOS","macOS","tvOS"],"keywords":["action classification","action classifier","bean bag toss","body pose","camera","cornhole","gesture","hand pose","machine learning","photo","pose estimation","ui control","video","vision"],"topicIds":[16],"type":"Session","images":["square","wide"],"codeSnippets":[{"title":"HandPoseCameraViewController","startTimeSeconds":427,"endTimeSeconds":488,"language":"swift","code":"<span class=\"syntax-class\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">extension</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">CameraViewController</span>: <span class=\"syntax-title\">AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"syntax-function\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">captureOutput</span><span class=\"syntax-params\">(<span class=\"syntax-number\">_</span> output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection)</span></span> {\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> thumbTip: <span class=\"syntax-type\">CGPoint?</span>\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> indexTip: <span class=\"syntax-type\">CGPoint?</span>\n        \n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">defer</span> {\n            <span class=\"syntax-type\">DispatchQueue</span>.main.sync {\n                <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">self</span>.processPoints(thumbTip: thumbTip, indexTip: indexTip)\n            }\n        }\n\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> handler = <span class=\"syntax-type\">VNImageRequestHandler</span>(cmSampleBuffer: sampleBuffer, orientation: .up, options: [:])\n        <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">do</span> {\n            <span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Perform VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest</span>\n            <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">try</span> handler.perform([handPoseRequest])\n            <span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Continue only when a hand was detected in the frame.</span>\n            <span class=\"syntax-comment\">// Since we set the maximumHandCount property of the request to 1, there will be at most one observation.</span>\n            <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">guard</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> observation = handPoseRequest.results?.first <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">as</span>?
